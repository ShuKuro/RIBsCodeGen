# RIBsCodeGen
RIBsCodeGen generate [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs) boilerplate. Router, Interactor, Builder and ViewController are created automatically following its templates.

RIBsCodeGen also resolves the dependencies between parent and child RIB. Not only add the ComponentExtension but also add the child listener and builder to parent Router, Builder. 

Additionally, the operation is enable to run for multiple RIBs. If write the RIBs tree by Markfown list style, RIBsCodeGen generate all RIBs following the tree. 

Let's save time to create RIBs as much as possible.
